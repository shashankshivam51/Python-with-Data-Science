polynomial regression analysis

this repository contains a python project for analyzing the relationship between variables using polynomial regression. the project includes data generation, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

project structure

- analysis.ipynb: jupyter notebook with data generation, analysis, visualization, and model training.

dependencies

- python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

setup

1. clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polynomial-regression-analysis.git
cd polynomial-regression-analysis
```

2. install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

3. open the jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
```

usage

import libraries:
- import necessary libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
- generate a dataset and visualize it using scatter plots.

train test split:
- split the dataset into training and testing sets.

simple linear regression:
- implement and train a simple linear regression model.
- evaluate the model and visualize the results.

polynomial transformation:
- apply polynomial transformation to the data.
- train polynomial regression models with different degrees.
- evaluate and visualize the models.

pipeline:
- create a pipeline for polynomial regression.
- train and visualize the model using the pipeline.

results

- visualization of the dataset.
- model coefficients and intercept.
- performance metrics (r-squared score).
- comparison of polynomial regression models with different degrees.
