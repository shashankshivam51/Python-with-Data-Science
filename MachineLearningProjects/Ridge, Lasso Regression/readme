## Introduction
Forest fires pose a significant threat to the environment and human life. This project analyzes the forest fire data from Algeria to understand the factors contributing to fire occurrences and build predictive models to anticipate future fires.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Algerian_forest_fires_cleaned_dataset.csv`. It contains data on various meteorological and geographical factors related to forest fires in Algeria.

### Features:
- **Date**: Date of the observation.
- **Temperature**: Temperature in Celsius.
- **RH**: Relative humidity in percentage.
- **Ws**: Wind speed in km/h.
- **Rain**: Rainfall in mm.
- **FFMC**: Fine Fuel Moisture Code.
- **DMC**: Duff Moisture Code.
- **DC**: Drought Code.
- **ISI**: Initial Spread Index.
- **BUI**: Buildup Index.
- **FWI**: Fire Weather Index.
- **Classes**: Indicates fire occurrence (fire/no fire).

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Algerian-Forest-Fires.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Algerian-Forest-Fires
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Model-Training.ipynb
    ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The notebook `Model-Training.ipynb` includes comprehensive EDA, where we visualize the distribution of features, correlations between variables, and trends over time.

## Model Training
The notebook also covers the training of various machine learning models to predict forest fire occurrences. The steps include:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## Results
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations of the model performance and feature importance are provided.
