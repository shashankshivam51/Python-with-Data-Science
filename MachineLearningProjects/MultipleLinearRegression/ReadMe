# Economic Index Analysis

This repository contains a Python project for analyzing economic indicators such as interest rates and unemployment rates. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, correlation analysis, model training, and evaluation using a Linear Regression model.

## Project Structure

- `economic_index.csv`: Dataset containing economic indicators.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, visualization, and model training.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/economic-index-analysis.git
cd economic-index-analysis
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset and drop unnecessary columns.
   - Check for null values.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Pairplot of all features.
   - Correlation matrix.
   - Scatter plot between interest rate and unemployment rate.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Standardize the features.
   - Train a Linear Regression model.
   - Evaluate the model using cross-validation.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Predict the test set results.
   - Calculate performance metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
   - Plot residuals and check the assumptions of the Linear Regression model.
   - Display the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression summary using statsmodels.

## Results

- Model coefficients.
- Performance metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, R-squared).
- Residuals analysis.
