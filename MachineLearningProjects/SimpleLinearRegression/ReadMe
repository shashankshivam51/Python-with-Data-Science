# Height-Weight Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Python project for analyzing the relationship between height and weight using a Linear Regression model. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `height-weight.csv`: Dataset containing height and weight data.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, visualization, and model training.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/height-weight-analysis.git
cd height-weight-analysis
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
```

## Usage

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
   - Check the correlation between height and weight.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Scatter plot of weight vs. height.
   - Pairplot of the dataset using seaborn.

3. Model Training:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Standardize the features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Train a Linear Regression model.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Display the model coefficients (slope and intercept).
   - Predict the test set results.
   - Calculate performance metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
   - Display the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression summary using statsmodels.

5. Prediction:
   - Predict the height for a new weight value.

## Results

- Model coefficients.
- Performance metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, R-squared).
- Visualization of training data and best-fit line.
- Residuals analysis and OLS regression summary.
